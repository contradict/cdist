t marker .cdist breaks
    - use random marker that starts with .cdist-
    - has fixed number of following characters (like 6 or 10)
    - write marker name to $__global/marker
    - export $__global/marker path as $__marker 
    - document variable in cdist-reference
        - also document the pattern how the marker is built
          so that other people may be able to dig into the structure
          from outside

t save method
    - in $__global/method
    - values
        - config
        - install
    - document path and description in cdist-reference

t save whole runtime in cache
    - missing items
        - initial manifest may be specified on commandline
            - always save the initial manifest to $__global/initial-manifest
                - currently it is a lost tempfile
        - remote exec / remote copy
            - save to $__global/remote_exec
            - save to $__global/remote_copy
    - stdout and stderr of everything
        - need to implement Steven's patch of stderr/stdout capturing
    - exit code of cdist
    - if it is complete, we can use it for replay / reconfigure

- new idea: replay / reconfig / reinstall
    - --from-cache?

t stderr/stdout
    - capture all messages
    - prefix with target_host
    - implementation exists in one of Steven's branches
        - ping steven for updated pull request

x on error dump all information about the failing object
    - where created
    - stderr
    - stdout
    - parameter (+values)
    - everything known [tm]

t multiple versions of cache
    - see #298

t absolute path of types, explorer
    - resolve instead of using the temporary link name
    - #305

t report command
    - from cache?
    - #306

t add session to "run directories"
    - instead of /var/lib/cdist (remote)
    - instead of static dir in cache 
    - same id remote and local
    - maybe timestamp
        - in or excluding the pid of cdist?

- cache
    - also save when cdist fails
    - save exit code
    - be able to restore config

- new command: cdist clean-cache
    - --since
    - --keep-versions --keep-lala $num

- cdist 4.0.0pre2
    - cleanup in preos

- logging for types
    cdist log ...?

    - cdist logserver
        - $__global/log.socket
        - fifo?
        echo into logpipe?
